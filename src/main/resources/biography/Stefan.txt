Stefan is a junior Java programmer with a curious mind and a passion for learning.
Although he works primarily in Java, Stefan loves experimenting with different programming languages, always eager to expand his technical horizons.
His enthusiasm for coding and his natural inclination to share what he's learned led him to start writing "dummy" programmer books—simple, beginner-friendly guides aimed at helping others get started with coding.

Stefan’s approach to teaching is practical and down-to-earth, making complex topics accessible to new programmers. He finds great joy in breaking down difficult concepts, and his books reflect his commitment to making programming more approachable for everyone.
